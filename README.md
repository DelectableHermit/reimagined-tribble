# reimagined-tribble
New to git/python/programming in general.  This program is written in Python and is command line based.
It will ask for a numerical input and pump out a corresponding amount of words based off of the "dice rolls" and word list.

Concept is based off of https://www.eff.org/dice.  The wordlist is based on their txt based version, but written as a json file instead.
Enjoy!
